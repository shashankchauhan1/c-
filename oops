Object Oriented Programming is a better or easy way to write programs. with the help of this we can represent the real life scenerio in our programs.

Classes and Objects: 

>> classes are the blueprint of these entities.         :::    blueprint means how objects are looks like.
>> Object are the entities in the real world. (entity means which exist).

class is like a company and object are the products of that company(both company and product has their own attributes).

class classname{
	// properties,attributes.
	// meathods.
}
