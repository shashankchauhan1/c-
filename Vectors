// VECTORS

vectors is a dynamic array in the normal arrays when we initialize array size we can't add more elements in the same array but in vectors we can add the elements 
HOW? , when the vector is full and we need to add one more element so it creates a new vector and and the size of this new vector is double then the size of its old vector,
and copy all the data to new vector and down the previous vector.

// initializing and printing the vector


int main(){
    vector<int> v={10,20,30,40,50};
    for(int elements : v){
        cout<<elements<<' ';
    }
    return 0;
}
